Speech Emotion Recognition. SER is the process of trying to recognise human emotion and effective states from speech. Since we use tone and pitch to express emotion through voice, SER is possible; but it is tough because emotions are subjective and annotating audio is challenging. We’ll use the mfcc, chroma, and mel features and use the RAVDESS datasets to recognise emotion on. We’ll build an MLP Classifier for the model.
